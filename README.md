# excel_bot

just a foundation, i haven't needed an excel bot in a long time

all it does right now is..

### extract
1. parse files, workbooks, and worksheets into dicts and such

### compare
2. look..  
      ..over a certain range..  
      ..with workbooks containing certain names..  
      ..with worksheets containing certain names..  
      ..for the provided search terms..  

### list
3. keeps a list of every cell address that matches all of the above

## not much else.
just a foundation for next time i need to do something with excel
